## Login:
- To initiate communication, each Pi is required to log in to the respective counterpart Pi.

## Rights:
- Every Pi possesses customizable access rights.

## Commands:
- Each Pi has the capability to transmit and execute commands.

## Files:
- Every Pi is capable of file transfer.
- Additionally, each Pi has the ability to perform, read, and write files.

## GPIO:
- All Pi units are capable of controlling each other's GPIO pins.

## Web-Interface:
- The web interface serves two main purposes:
  - It displays comprehensive statistics about the cluster.
  - It enables external manipulation of the cluster.

- For external connections, the utilization of data encryption is mandatory.
- Communication within the cluster, however, remains unencrypted.

## API:
- An API is provided to empower programmers in tailoring the cluster according to their needs.

## Implication:
- Process distribution leads to effective load balancing.
- This setup offers meticulous oversight over intricate robotics projects.
- Efficient distribution of data follows suit.

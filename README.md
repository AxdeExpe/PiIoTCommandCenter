# Raspberry Pi Communication API

This API allows multiple Single-Board-Computer (raspberry pi preferred) to communicate with each other.

The following functionalities are available:
- Sending, writing, reading, and executing files.
- Remote control of GPIO pins on other Raspberry Pis (Raspi -> Raspi).
- For intercommunication control, you can log in from one Raspberry Pi to another and distribute permissions.
- Each authorized Raspberry Pi can retrieve files of any type.
- Each Raspberry Pi can send commands to another.

## Code

The code is stored at /src
- There is the server and the client side
-> At the Client side therre you can interact with the API
-> The server side is the actual API

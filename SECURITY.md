2. Describe the issue in as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce it if applicable.

3. Our security experts will review your report and aim to respond within 14 days to discuss the next steps.

## Responsibilities

Our security team is responsible for reviewing and appropriately responding to reported security issues. We strive to provide a response within 14 days, depending on the severity of the issue.

## Disclosure of Security Issues

After resolving a security issue, we will collaborate with the security researcher or reporter to determine when and how information about the security vulnerability will be disclosed. We are committed to responsible disclosure of security issues.

## Reporting Guidelines

- If you prefer encrypted communication, please use PGP/GPG for your emails to our security team.
- Please refrain from disclosing details of security issues until they have been resolved or until we have mutually agreed upon a disclosure strategy.

Thank you for your dedication and assistance in securing the PiIoTCommandCenter project.

If you want to become a contributor, please send me an email (s83799@htw-dresden.de) with further project ideas or send me code snippets as solutions for potential issues. You're also welcome to enhance or edit the documentation. Additionally, you should be active and enjoy working on the project while providing support. I / we will then get in touch with you to learn more about each other. Once this "application phase" is complete, you're welcome to join in!
